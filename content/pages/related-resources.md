Writing Web Links
-----------------

The following links are helpful places to do further investigation into good writing:

Swan, Judith A., and George D. Gopen. "The Science of Scientific Writing." _American Scientist_ 78 (November-December 1990): 550-558. ({{% resource_link "bc932f59-871f-4139-b135-ac5c6061fda1" "PDF" %}}) - A very useful article that analyzes the structure and style of scientific writing.

Writing Up Research - A fairly comprehensive explanation of the components of the research article from the Asian Institute of Technology.

Writing in the Neurobiological Sciences - A scientific writing course from the University of Florida with many useful links.

{{% resource_link "30429b62-a01b-4f58-bd83-4d1811fb3a17" "Writing Guidelines for Engineering and Science Students" %}} - A useful resource on scientific writing from Penn State. Includes many examples and additional links.

{{% resource_link "3db9aff7-75ea-429b-b759-5f3c4b129989" "Instructions to Authors in the Health Sciences" %}} - This site provides links to instructions to authors for over 3,500 journals in the health and life sciences.
